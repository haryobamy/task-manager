## API Integration

The app uses a mock backend powered by JSON Server to provide CRUD functionality for tasks.

### Starting the Mock Backend

1. Install JSON Server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
2. Run the mock server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed via a live URL.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean, modular, and scalable structure with the following directories:

- **/src**
  - **components**: Reusable UI components
  - **context**: State management using React redux
  - **pages**: Main application pages
  - **services**: API interaction logic
  - **styles**: Global styles and theme configuration

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Clear type definitions for components and API interactions
- Strong type safety to minimize runtime errors
